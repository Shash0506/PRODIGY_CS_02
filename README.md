Prodigy Infotech Task - 2

üñºÔ∏è Project Overview

This repository contains my solution for Task 03 of the Prodigy Infotech Internship. The task involved implementing image encryption using pixel manipulation techniques in Python.

üìä Objective

 Develop a Python program that:
  1. Loads an image.
  2. Encrypts the image by manipulating its pixel values using a custom logic.
  3. Allows decryption to retrieve the original image.
  4. Utilizes libraries like Pillow and NumPy for image processing.

üéØ Conclusion
  
   Through this project, I explored:
    1. Image processing using Pillow and NumPy.
    2. Concepts of pixel-based encryption.
    3.Secure storage and transformation of image data
